                <h2>My Mission (In Progress!)</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to GameHub! I’m passionate about video games and aim to create a simple, elegant space for discovering and appreciating them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GameHub is currently in the early stages of development. My goal is to build a community-driven platform where gamers can revisit and celebrate classic games.
                </p>

                    <h3>About Game Downloads</h3>
                    <p>
                        Many of the games featured on GameHub are available for download via torrent files. Torrents enable fast and reliable peer-to-peer sharing of large files, making it easier for you to access the games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To download these games, you will need a compatible torrent client such as <em>qBittorrent</em>, <em>Transmission</em>, or <em>uTorrent</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please ensure that you have the legal right to download and use the games in your region. GameHub does not host any game files directly and serves as an informational platform to help gamers discover content.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                       GameHub features games considered abandonware or no longer actively sold by their original publishers. 
                       However, copyright ownership remains with the original creators, and we encourage users to respect all applicable copyright laws
